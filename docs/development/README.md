# Libp2p

Libp2p protocols can be divided into 2 layers:

- Transport layer protocols, that actively use peer address to discover network and establish connection
- Application layer protocols, that is used to exchange actual payload once the connection is active.

To contribute to libp2p stack or build your own, kindly check [developing a transport layer protocol](./transport-layer.md) and also [the list of best practices](./best-practices.md).
