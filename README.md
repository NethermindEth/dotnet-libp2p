# dotnet-libp2p

[![Test](https://github.com/nethermindeth/dotnet-libp2p/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nethermindeth/dotnet-libp2p/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Nethermind.Libp2p](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Nethermind.Libp2p)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethermind.Libp2p)

The project aims to implement [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) to unlock building .NET peer-to-peer applications using a battle-tested specification of network communication of the new age.

As an application developer, you may consider reading [quick start](./docs/quick-start.md).
As a stack implementer, you may be interested in [more advanced tutorials](./docs/development/README.md).

## Roadmap

From the beginning, the target is to provide a performant well-tested implementation that works on multiple platforms. With high throughput and low memory profile. The modules to be implemented firstly should cover basic P2P application needs.
