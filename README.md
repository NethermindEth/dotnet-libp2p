The project aims to implement [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) to unlock building .NET peer-to-peer applications using a battle-tested specification of network communication of the new age.

As an application developer, you may consider reading [quick start](./docs/README.md).
As a stack implementer, you may be interested in [more advanced tutorials](./docs/development/README.md).

**Contributions are welcome**, kindly check the [issues](https://github.com/NethermindEth/dotnet-libp2p/issues) tab, everything there if not assigned to a person can be taken into work. More details in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building the solution

The solution depends on external repositories.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NethermindEth/dotnet-libp2p.git --recursive
cd ./src/libp2p/
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

## Roadmap

ðŸš§ The library is not stable and under heavy development. Consider the [beta](https://github.com/NethermindEth/dotnet-libp2p/milestone/5) milestone as a reflection of readiness for production ðŸš§

The target is to provide a performant well-tested implementation of a wide range of protocols that works on multiple platforms, with high throughput and low memory profile.
